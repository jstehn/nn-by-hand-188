# Neural Network By Hand

This was a project I did for Berkeley in which we implemented neural networks by hand.

You may note that the models are hardcoded. This is not how I would typically do software engineering, however our goal was not to recreate the flexibility and power of libraries of PyTorch. This was largely an excercise in understanding of neural networks with some programming as a side goal.
